Getting 70-80% accuracy for now, depending on the parameters, needs little more tuning

Improvements : 
1. use pretrained word embeddings (GloVE or something)
2. use NER to replace company names with <company>
3. replace numbers with <number>

Other:
1. try out regression
2. download Apple finance news from Yahoo finance and/or reddit
3. download Apple stock market data
4. try out for Apple

--------------

Tried out different regression models (regression_model.py)
- mean absolute error on train set around 0.1
- mean absolute error on validation set around 0.22
